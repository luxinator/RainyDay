# RainyDay
A tutorial in Spark, HDFS, Solr and Angular

## Goal of this project

In this project we will build historical wheater page called *RainyDay*. We will built this from opensource software using everyday hardware.
For that to work we need to take the following steps:

- Gather the data
- Transform it to a easy format (JSON)
- Index it
- Disclose it as an API
- Build a web/app to show the data/query

For this we are going to use the following software packages:

- Apache NiFi (gather)
- Apache HDFS (save)
- Apache Spark (transform)
- Apache Solr (index)
- Angular (visualize)

Please Read and do in the following order:
